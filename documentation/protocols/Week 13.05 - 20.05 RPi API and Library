Library:
Short analysis of the HAT library that was provided by the EEIS Team shows that there is a class to access the motor and a class to access the color sensor.
There is no provision yet for the distance sensor, so we might have to code that.
Also, we might want to look into the way the color class works and how it gets color attributes from the sensors. It seems like there are some attributes to the color, like hue etc., and we are not yet sure if the class in the library collapses these or makes them available.

We also checked the comments on the sensors in the HAT protocol and apparently the color sensor also senses some types of light, i.e. the reflectedlight and the ambiantlight. Maybe with the color containing also hue, value and saturation, and with saturation we might be able to create something of a gradient.


To Do's: 
- build cases for the RPi and for the batteries and build them on the RPi
- place the sensors on the RPi
- Understand the libraries classes
- Understand the properties of the color sensor output
- Understand the properties of the distance sensor output
- Test sensor callbacks with API if possible and otherwise with python or better C++ (for the distance sensor)

Next Meeting: maybe Friday morning Kevin and Vera

Final Besprechung before tuesday: 18:30 Monday evening
