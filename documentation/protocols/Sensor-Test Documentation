Distance sensor:
select modes returning valuable data:
- 0: according to manual distance in mm, range: 40 mm - 740 mm, note: it goes further (2000 mm), but it will need a 90 degree angle and widely free view
- 1: according to manual distance in mm, range: 40 mm - 320 mm
- 4: assuming it's raw time of sonic, not tested unit

Color Sensor
select modes tested, returning valuable data:
- 0: Color sensor, for reliable data keep a maximum distance of 4 cm, closer distances seem to be more reliable
- 1: Reflection sensor, higher values mean brighter, more withe colors or surfaces, lower numbers mean darker, black like surfaces
- 2: ambient 
- 3: light
- 4: re-reflection??
- 5: probably rgb + Brightness
