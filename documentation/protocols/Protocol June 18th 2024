- only have two weeks left to meet requirements (we might have to adjust requirements)
- updates from last week:
Robert (research possibilities to save and send data):
- csv or something else → csv is what is implemented now, so we might as well use it
- scp secure copy protocol to send the files from the computer to the raspberry pi
Yin and Kevin (continuing work on the remote control from the week before (Yin and Vera)):
- remote control works, some refactoring done
Yessmine and Zied (BC Algorithm):
- ready to actually receive real data

need:
sanity check (do the actions we receive from the backend algorithm follow some kind of trend? Do they make sense? Or might they be completely random?)
convert data from csv into txt and send it over (scp)
reformat data in remote control code
Agent on the rpi (collect data in c++, use argmax function (take max from table), return action, that action will be taken up by agent code (needs to be changed))
change filename convention

really collect data!!!

How is everyones manager role going?
Yessmine: work on CI/CD pipeline this week
Robert: conversion csv/text and scp
Kevin/Yin: need to write tests (3-5 unit tests per code segment (bc algorithm, protocol, control..) , do code reviews, 
Zied/Vera: distribute issues, please independently move issues into done or inform someone to review; what needs to be done towards the end? → be more consistent with issues + update Gantt chart + add/reduce project goals

goal for today: get the robot to collect real data and receive it to the backend code so the bc algorithm can be tested
who: all that are here
wrap up for today: make issues about what remains to be done; go over issues that exist and move into done when done
