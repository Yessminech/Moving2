TOPIC 1 - Organization:

Milestone 2 presenters: Yessmine, Robert
Willie will be gone from May 26th to June 2nd --> Test presentation should happen before


TOPIC 2.1 - hear from the groups - Prototype and next plans:

The group agreed to continue working with the skiing robot
The next Task would be to include sensors and pi into the design to have a functional prototype -> Task
We also need to do some testing and prototypes, to test the sensors position, as well as return values -> task for next week
We discussed the gradient idea: discrete vs continuous color areas. For now we will stick with the discrete color space
We also need to check the API for sensor capability, and consider time which might be needed to implement
We need to check and understand the API to control motors with c++ and collect sensor data via API -> Task for next week
The integration manager should come up with a diagram (UML) -> second milestone
WE finally need to find two RL algorithms and key aspects (advantages, disadvantages) -> Task for next week 
Each of the focus groups should come up with a presentation, either for RL Algorithm or for API usage
Willie organized a PC from TEL: We can overwrite the old OS on this PC to get started -> Fix  it , Task for next week
Comment of Willie: stable base line 3 library -> well known for RL Algorithms. We should take a look on it

TOPIC 3 - Priorities for tasks and groups:
1. API/Sensor- Group: Vera, Robert, Kevin
Install Sensors
Test sensor Callbacks

Time plan:
Check API (Sensors) - Vera
Sensor Prototype 
Check RPI HAT API
2. RL/Backend-Group: Zied, Yessmine, Wangdong
research Algorithms
prepare presentation
setup Backend PC - Zied

TOPIC 4 - how is everyones manager role going?
Project Mangers: Are doing fine
Technical Manager: Is doing fine
git branches should be: dev, main and one for each feature we are working on
Integration Manger: Propses Protobuf and Cap N' Proto as fast binary formats for data exchange,  TODO: UML- Diagram
Quality Managers: Need to come up with a c++ Coding Style, lower priority task develop a test plan

TOPIC 5 - Assign moderator and note-taker for next week
Moderator: Robert, Minuttaker: Kevin
