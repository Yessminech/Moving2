Moderator today: Robert
Minute-taker: Kevin (maybe someone different today bcs he is only joining via zoom
Agenda, possible points:

- hear from the groups: hardware(test of sensors, consider given library, develop prototype further); software(setup of computer w/ architecture, choice of algorithms)
- how is everyones manager role going?
- plan for next week, assign responsibilities
(according to last week and gantt chart, the following tasks need to be completed in the following weeks/week:
- choose algorithm to implement first, get on it
- hardcode movement in robot to practice and have better understanding
- write missing functions for the distance sensor
- build our testing infrastructure
- specify our reward function

- idea: collect all our specifications in one document (action space, observation space, algorithms, reward function, etc...)
- Assign moderator and note-taker for next week


Protocol : 

  Software :
    -Computer set up (ubuntu is installed, credentials to github) (computer in the corner)
      -> Everyone should login with their git credentials 

    -Algorithm : PPO : Well adapted for task 
                  -Problem : not easily applicable for offline learning 
                  -Decide if we want to do offline learning (and decide what to do on that basis) 
                Mixed Space : can we use a Mixed observation space ?
                  -> if not there are 2 solutions
                    -Discretise Distance
                    -make color continuous (gradient) 

              => Decision : Offline Learning (yessmine) 
              => TODO : research offline RL ALgorithm until Thursday (requirements : offline, easy to implement, -focus on discrete- )
                      - Thursday : present algorithm research (zied , yin )


  Hardware : 
              -RPI : found place to fix
              -Batteries : found place for batteries
              -distance : not yet

            API :
                -distance : functions for distance sensor need to be written (TODO)
                -distance : up to 1 meter
                -color : functions for continuous color sensor 
                -needs to be worked on
                -motors : needs to be tried on motors

Technical Manager: 
            - do CI Pipeline : write CI Script ( 5 Lines of script ) (Yessmine) 

Quality managers : 
            - define Writing Style (Quality managers: Yin , Kevin ) 


Enviorenment : 
            -check what we need and tell willie to order
