We chose offline lerning as our prefered method, due to it's easier comunication handling. Therefore we don't have a protocol which is worth to mention. But where did we end up? We rely on csv files to transfer our explorations, and the results after training. This way we decided to rely on the simple scp protocol, which ensures file transfer between our Raspberry Pi and the linux backend. At the moment we have a bash script, which can be configured and later be called manually, or from inside the program torun the transfer. To make it work, the Reinforcement learning group defined how the file should look like. You can find the markdown in this repo. We ensure the correct format by parsing the received file in a conversion function, which brings everything together.
