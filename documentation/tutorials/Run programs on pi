**in progress**

# Address motors and sensors directly in terminal (with python)
- Run setup file
- Run putty in the terminal, choose Standard_Test in pop-up window, double click
- type list to see all ports and corresponding modi
- for any device/port to use, turn it on by typing 'set -1'

- Sensor: 
- choose port by typing port <port number>
- choose modus by typing select <modus number>
--> receive data

- Motor:
- choose port by typing port <port number>
- choose motor power by typing plimit <limit> (for instance 1 (remove power limit) or 0.1 (default for experimenting)
- check p. 11 of Build HAT Serial Protocol (ISIS) for examples of how to move the motors
                                                                                       

# Run C++ executables on pi
Some examples are already in the library and you can run their executables (in buildhat++/bin).
- configure motors and sensors in config file (i.e. which port corresponds to which sensor/motor)
- navigate into the directory, to run executable type ./<executable name>
- **note on the examples: the examples contain a main that call a setup function that can be found in buildhat.cpp**

                                                                                           
# Create executables on pi (we'll add some more concrete info)
- compile
- add executable in CMakeLists.txt
