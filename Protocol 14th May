- everyone implement/read through software results and then ask any questions if we have

-Organization:
Milestone 2 presenters: Yessmine, Robert
- hear from the groups
- Prototype:
agreed to continue the skiing robot
include sensors and pi into design -> Task
try and test color sensor (data, position) -> task for next week
gradient idea: discrete vs continuous
Check API for sensor capability, consider time to implemet
Chack and understand API to control motors and collect sensor data -> Task for next week
Diagram -> second milestone
Find RL algorithm and key aspects (advantages, disadvantages) -> Task for next week 
presentation for RL Algorithm and Presentation for API usage
PC from TEL: overwrite old OS on old PC tomget started -> FIx  it , Task for next week
stable  base line 3 library -> well known for RL Algs
Task priorisation:
1. API/Sensor- Group: Vera, Robert, Kevin
Install Sensors
Test sensor Callbacks

Time plan:
Check API (Sensors) - Vera
Sensor Prototype 
Check RPI HAT API
2. RL/Backend-Group: Zied, Yessmine, 
research Algorithms
prepare presentation
setup Backend PC - Zied
3
- how is everyones manager role going?
Project: Fine
Technical: Fine
dev, main, each feature branch
Integration: UML- Diagram
Quality: Coding Style cpp, lower priority test plan

- Assign moderator and note-taker for next week
mod: Robert, Note: Kevin
