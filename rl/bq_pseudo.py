# ## Design State Representation
# def read_sensor_data():
#     # Read color and distance sensor data
#     color_data = ...  # Read color sensor data
#     distance_data = ...  # Read distance sensor data
    
#     # Preprocess sensor data
#     state = (color_data, distance_data)  # Combine sensor data into state representation
#     return state

# ## Define Action Space:
# actions = [(speed_forward, speed_backward) for speed_forward in range(2) for speed_backward in range(2)]

# ## Implement Q-Learning Algorithm:
# import numpy as np

# # Initialize Q-values
# num_actions = len(actions)
# q_values = np.zeros((num_states, num_actions))

# # Define reward function
# def reward_function(state, action):
#     # Define reward based on state and action
#     reward = ...
#     return reward
    
# # Q-learning update rule
# def q_learning_update(state, action, reward, next_state):
#     # Update Q-value based on Q-learning update rule
#     alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
#     gamma = 0.9  # Discount factor
#     max_next_q = np.max(q_values[next_state])
#     q_values[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * max_next_q - q_values[state, action])
    
# # Exploration vs. Exploitation
#     # Exploration refers to trying out different actions to discover potentially better strategies,
#     # while exploitation involves choosing actions that are currently believed to be the best based
#     # on the learned Q-values. The ε-greedy policy balances exploration and exploitation by choosing
#     # a random action with probability ε (exploration) and choosing the action with the highest Q-value
#     # with probability 1-ε (exploitation).
# def epsilon_greedy_policy(state, epsilon):
#     if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
#         return np.random.choice(num_actions)
#     else:
#         return np.argmax(q_values[state])
