I have upload buildhat_firmwre in github(Branch develpe)


we add a file in "/home/moving2/test"(raspberry pi) and name is "buildhat_firmware".

  
if you wanna use library of C++ and you should install the path of "FIRMWARE_BASE_PATH[]". The initial path is "home/pi/BuildHat/firmwar/" and you just adjust the path to "/home/moving2/test/buildhat_firmwar/" the location of "buildhat_fireware"
